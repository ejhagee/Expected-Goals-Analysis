    "# Expected Goals Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Goals (xG) is the most popular advanced metric for association football (soccer) analysis.  In it's most basic form, it is a measurement of the probability of a particular shot resulting in a goal.  Variables taken into account include distance and angle of shot, as well as the part of the body used to take the shot.  Non-shot xG models can also be developed that perform the same task, but measure expected goals based on actions such as interceptions near goal.  In any case, expected goals for a game and/or season can be summed for a description of team performance besides the scorelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we look at the predicted (xG) versus actual (G) results across various professional leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to the work required to calculate the variables for a shot, typically involving video of the shot in question, expected goal data is not widely available.  However, some free public sources exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fivethirtyeight.com (538) uses two expected goals models (shot-based and non-shot based) as part of its soccer league forecasting.  The data for summed expected goals models (as well as actual results) is published periodically game-by-game.  This data is used as a first start for investigation.  As expected goals models can have a decently high variance game-by-game, we sum up for individual seasons in any case."
